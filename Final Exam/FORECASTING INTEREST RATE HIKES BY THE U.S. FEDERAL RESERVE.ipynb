    "The federal funds rate is the key interest rate that the U.S. Federal Reserve uses to influence economic growth. The Federal Open Market Committee meets regularly to decide whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the target interest rate. Their choice has important ramifications that cascade through the economy, so the announcement of the interest rates is eagerly awaited each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will use analytics to try to predict when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. We will look at monthly economic and political data dating back to the mid-1960's. In this analysis, the dependent variable will be the binary outcome variable RaisedFedFunds, which takes value 1 if the federal funds rate was increased that month and 0 if it was lowered or stayed the same. For each month, the file federalFundsRate.csv contains the following independent variables:\n",
