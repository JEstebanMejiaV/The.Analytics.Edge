    "The use of coal in the United States peaked in 2005, and since then has decreased by 25%, being replaced by renewable energy sources and more efficient use (Lovins, 2014). As the United States pursues a portfolio of more diverse, sustainable and secure energy sources, there are many questions to consider. What are effective factors in incentivizing states to adopt more environmentally friendly energy generation methods? How do these factors vary by state? How can we direct resources to different places in the country and ensure that they effectively drive renewable energy sources adoption? To derive insights and answer these questions, we take a combination of generation, usage, and greenhouse emission data by state and combine it with macro-economic and political information.\n",

    "For this problem, we gathered data from various sources to include the following information for each state within the U.S. for the years spanning year 2000 to year 2013. The aggregated dataset energy.csv results in a total of 27 variables and 699 observations. Each observation contains one record per state per year. Here's a detailed description of the variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "- GenHydro, GenSolar: Annual generation of energy using each type of energy source as a percent of the total energy generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GenTotalRenewableBinary, GenSolarBinary: 1 if generation from solar or other renewable energy sources increased between a year n and a year n+1. 0 if it did not increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AllSourcesCO2, AllSourcesSO2 and AllSourcesNOx: Annual emissions per state in metric tons, normalized by the respective state population at a given year and caused by all energy generation sources.\n",

    "- ESalesResidential, ESalesCommercial, ESalesIndustrial, ESalesTransportation, ESalesTotal: Annual normalized sales of electricity per state, per sector.\n",
