    "An important application of linear regression is understanding sales. Consider a company that produces and sells a product. In a given period, if the company produces more units than how many consumers will buy, the company will not earn money on the unsold units and will incur additional costs due to having to store those units in inventory before they can be sold. If it produces fewer units than how many consumers will buy, the company will earn less than it potentially could have earned. Being able to predict consumer sales, therefore, is of first order importance to the company.\n",

    "In this problem, we will try to predict monthly sales of the Hyundai Elantra in the United States. The Hyundai Motor Company is a major automobile manufacturer based in South Korea. The Elantra is a car model that has been produced by Hyundai since 1990 and is sold all over the world, including the United States. We will build a linear regression model to predict monthly sales using economic indicators of the United States as well as Google search queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our model R-Squared is relatively low, so we would now like to improve our model. In modeling demand and sales, it is often useful to model seasonality. Seasonality refers to the fact that demand is often cyclical/periodic in time. For example, in countries with different seasons, demand for warm outerwear (like jackets and coats) is higher in fall/autumn and winter (due to the colder weather) than in spring and summer. (In contrast, demand for swimsuits and sunscreen is higher in the summer than in the other seasons.) Another example is the \"back to school\" period in North America: demand for stationary (pencils, notebooks and so on) in late July and all of August is higher than the rest of the year due to the start of the school year in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem, since our data includes the month of the year in which the units were sold, it is feasible for us to incorporate monthly seasonality. From a modeling point of view, it may be reasonable that the month plays an effect in how many Elantra units are sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate the seasonal effect due to the month, build a new linear regression model that predicts monthly Elantra sales using Month as well as Unemployment, CPI_all, CPI_energy and Queries. Do not modify the training and testing data frames before building the model.\n",
